/* psprecomp -- a window to play in.

 * Shows the PSP display, scaled, and turns the keyboard and the first game
 * controller into sceCtrl input. It runs on a host thread of its own and
 * reads the game's front buffer on a 60 Hz timer, so it never waits on the
 * game and the game never waits on it.
